  This time in Gurgaon, we are having a mix of some of the most relevant and trending topics in the world of Software Testing and not  limiting to one aspect of testing as we had in our earlier vodQA versions.

  <br/>
  vodQA, as a preferred platform for the QA community pan India is turning 5 years with this edition. This time its not that you are just an audience listening to ThoughtWorkers but also have a chance to speak to your fellow testing community.

  The speaker registrations are now open and we invite you to submit your talks for the upcoming edition of vodQA.
