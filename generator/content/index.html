    The 'BIG DATA RAINBOW' introduces participants to the world of Big Data!
    <br/>
    The first half covers the landscape of Apache Hadoop: MapReduce, Yarn, Sqoop, Hive and Oozie, concepts of Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS) and introduction to functional programming with Scala for Hadoop based applications.
    <br/>
    The second half covers introduction to Apache Spark, concepts of Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) and DataFrames in Spark and hands on workshop of testing Apache Spark based application using ScalaTest.
    <br/>
    vodQA is a preferred platform for the QA community pan India. We invite you to join us for a day full of exciting talks and hands on workshop.
